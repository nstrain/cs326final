This project turns on a light when a room goes dark or a bluetooth MAC address is found for the first time. It was made with the intention of turning on a dim light for roomates that come back to the room late at night. The raspberry pi can also optionally communicate with a webserver so that it is possible to check the ocupancy of a room.
