This is a project I'm working on for my iot class. I started it last night becasue why not. The code isn't finished but it is functional. This project is centered around making my dorm room more convinient for my roomate and I. We have different schedules, and quite often we find ourselves in the dark because the other is sleeping. The raspberry pi scanns for the mac address of my phone and turns on an led when the room is dark and it detects I have returned. It also turns the light on if the room suddenly goes dark. In both cases the Light is on a timer so it shuts off autimatically after a few seconds. The pi also uploads a "status" to a heroku app that communicates with elephantsql. This is nice because if a phone's mac address is detected it changes a webpage (nls26.github.io) so that my roomate and I know the other is already there and if we have to take a call or online class another location might be better.
